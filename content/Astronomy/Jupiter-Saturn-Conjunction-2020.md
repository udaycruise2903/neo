# Jupiter-Saturn Conjunction 2020

The 2020 Great Conjunction was the closest approach of Jupiter and Saturn since 1623 and they will not come so close again until their 2080 great conjunction.

I along with my friends organised a skywatch event on the terrace of BVJ Science Centre in Jayanagar. We used a 6-inch reflecting telescope.
