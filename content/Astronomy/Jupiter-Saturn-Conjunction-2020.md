# Jupiter-Saturn Conjunction 2020

The 2020 Great Conjunction will be the closest approach of Jupiter and Saturn since 1623 and they will not come so close again until their 2080 great conjunction.

I and my friends collectively organised a skywatch event on the terrace of BVJ Science Centre in Jayanagar. We used a 6-inch reflecting telescope.
