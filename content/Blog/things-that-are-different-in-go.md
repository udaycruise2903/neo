# Things that are different in Go

1. if values are unassigned to datatypes, then default value is 0(int & float), false(boolean), ""(string).
2. `t "time"` with this we can use t instead of time in while using package functions.
3. type of data is inferred when variable is declared using `:=`
4. Go checks the architecture of a user's computer(32-bit or 64-bit), then uses a relevant bit size of a datatype.
