***** Monoids and Semigroups

1. *(head . tail) tail* computes the third element of a list.
2. Lists are an instance of Semigroup with (++) as (<>):
   [1] <> [2,3] => [1,2,3]

    #+begin_src haskell
    data Sum a = Sum a
    instance Num a => Semigroup (Sum a) where
        Sum a <> Sum b = Sum (a + b)

    data Product a = Product a
    instance Num a => Semigroup (Product a) where
        Product a <> Product b = Product (a * b)
